# SeleniumJavaTestProject

Framework OverView :

I have used Selenium , Core Java , Allure Reports , Testng as a framework , log 4j for logging and Page Object Model as a design pattern.

Execution steps :

Run using maven command : mvn clean install 

After the execution of test case , generate allure reports using command : " allure serve " to check the no of test cases that are passed or failed.
